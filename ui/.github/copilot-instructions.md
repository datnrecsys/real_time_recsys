# Shopping Recommendation UI Project

This is a React + Vite project for a shopping recommendation system UI. The application:

- Fetches recommendation data from an API endpoint
- Displays recommended items sorted by their scores
- Provides a modern shopping interface with styling
- Uses JSON format: `{ "userid": id, "recommendations": [item_a, item_b, item_c], "score": [score_a, score_b, score_c] }`

When generating code for this project:
- Use modern React patterns with functional components and hooks
- Apply responsive design principles
- Focus on user experience and clean, modern styling
- Handle API responses and error states appropriately
- Sort items by their scores in descending order (highest scores first)
